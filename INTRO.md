My name is Josh Casey also known as "loganxart" on the internet, social medias sites, etc. I'm 38 years old and have a background in 3D Animation, Modeling and CGI special effects for the film industry. I'm originally from Nashville, Tennessee, but have called Boston, MA, Cupertino, CA, and now in the Washington, DC area home. I was a politial activist for many years and for nearly 2 years volunteered at the White House Peace Vigil. The longest running Peace Vigil in the world. (Tent in front of the White House for 35+ years.)

Im easily able to be found in DC's coffee shops and in DC's many parks talking about cryptocurrencies, blockchain and the future of the world. I teach, educate those with interest in the crypto world about smart investments, security culture, the political atmosphere in DC concerning blockchain technology, crypto and digital currencies. I sit in the Senate sub-committee hearings when the issue of crypto is being discussed.

I advocate for a decentralized internet where the bigwigs dont have full control of your content, your personal information, where you share what you only want to share and participate only where you want to.

I do not and will never put profit, corporations or special interest groups in front of the people I care for.

I do not support the throttling of internet services, bandwidth or access to the internet for any reason. I believe the internet should be completely open to those who wish to use it. Without restrictions, censorships imposed by corporations or governements.(Net Neutrality)
