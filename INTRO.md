My name is Josh Casey also known as "loganxart" on the internet, social medias sites, etc. I'm originally from Nashville, Tennessee, but have caled home Boston, MA, Cupertino, CA, and now in the Washington, DC area. I was a politial activist for many years and did nearly 2 years at the White House Peace Vigil. (Tent in front of the White House.)

Im easily able to be found in DC's coffee shops and in parks talking about cryptocurrencies. I teach, educate those with interest in the crypto world about smart investments, security culture, the political atmoshpere in DC concerning crypto and digital currencies. I sit in the Senate sub-committee hearings when the issue of crypto is being discussed.

I advocate for a decentralized internet where the bigwigs dont have full control of your content, your personal information, where you share what you only want to share and participate only where you want to.

I do not and will never put profit, corporations' special interest groups in front of the people I care for.

I do not support the throttling of internet services, bandwidth or access to the internet for any reason. I believe the internet should be completely open to those who wish to use it. Without restrictions, cesnsorships imposed by corporations or governements.(Net Neutrality)
