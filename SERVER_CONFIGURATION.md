Location is Washington, DC.

During TestNet I am running a Dell Intel DualCore i3-3120M @ 2.50GHz with 16GBs of ram and 1TB hd with 64bit Linux. A gaming laptop maxxed out with all the bells and whistles.

I am currently building a transaction-node from scratch. Equivilant or better than a mainframe or IBM i Version 7.2 or a System Z. 

It will have *2TBs of ram with *128TB of space. *with room to double both, althought I think I may expand beyond that.
